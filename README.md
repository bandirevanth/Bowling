# Bowling
This is a fairly straight conversion to python with some exceptions.  I have kept most of the upper case text that the program prints. I have added the feature of giving names to players. I have added a Player class to store player data in. This last change works around the problems in the original storing data in a matrix. The original had bugs in calculating indexes which meant that the program would overwrite data in the matrix, so the results printed out contained errors. The last change is to do with the strict rules which allow extra rolls if the player scores a spare or strike in the last frame. This program allows these extra rolls and also calculates the proper score.
